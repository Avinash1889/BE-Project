Development of an Autonomous Weed Elimination and Spraying Robot for Precision Agriculture
The autonomous robot is designed to autonomously navigate agricultural fields, detect and identify weeds with high accuracy using advanced computer vision algorithms, and selectively eliminate them. Leveraging state-of-the-art sensing, artificial intelligence, and robotic technologies, the robot operates with efficiency and precision, providing targeted weed elimination while minimizing herbicide usage
